<h3>About this App</h3>
<p>
    This web app is build off modern web methodologies using a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. All the components
    are fully reusable sets of code that run independent from the rest of the application.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
    Security is handled by a custom ASP.Net Identity system. ASP.NET Identity can be used with all of the ASP.NET frameworks,
    such as ASP.NET MVC, Web Forms, Web Pages, Web API, and SignalR. ASP.NET Identity can be used when you are building web,
    phone, store, or hybrid applications. When a user is registered with our system we can grant them access to one or many
    applications based on their security profile. The same login credentials will grant access to a whole suite of applications.
</p>
<p>
    After a succesfull login the client is issued a JWT Bearer Token for security. This contains all the basic information we
    need to authorize that user. We include in the JWT Token a username and id as well as role and permission data. This
    token also includes an expiration date. Once authenticated the client will have access until the token expires or the
    user logs out. We then use this information to control the UI presented to the user on the client as well as passing
    this token with each request to be authenticated on the server.
</p>
<p>
    The JWT Bearer tokens are digitally signed using a HMAC algorithm and an secret key on the server, meaning they can be verified
    and trusted. With each request for information from the client we include the Token and verify it on the server before
    any data is returned to the client. Https will ensure end to end security for the tokens.
</p>

<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
<p>
    The overall solution consists of a html5 client front end app, a web api with a MVC information head, and a SQL backend.
    Both the client and web api can be scaled indefinetly to respond to demand. As different clients are added we can also
    scale out just the api as needed.
